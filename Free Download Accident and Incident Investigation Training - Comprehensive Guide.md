## Case Study: Applying Investigation Principles

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario: A worker slips and falls on a wet floor in a warehouse.

*   **Immediate Actions:** Provide first aid to the injured worker and secure the area to prevent further incidents.
*   **Investigation:** Gather information by interviewing the worker, witnesses, and reviewing security footage. Examine the area to identify the source of the water and any contributing factors.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Using the 5 Whys, the investigation might reveal that the water was leaking from a damaged pipe, which was not regularly inspected, due to a lack of a preventative maintenance program.
*   **Corrective Actions:** Repair the leaking pipe, implement a regular inspection and maintenance program, and provide slip-resistant footwear to workers.

This example highlights the importance of a thorough investigation and root cause analysis in preventing future accidents.
