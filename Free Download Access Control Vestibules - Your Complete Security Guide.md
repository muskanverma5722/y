*   **Tailgating Prevention:** Deters individuals from following authorized personnel.
*   **Controlled Access:** Provides a defined entry and exit point.
*   **Reduced Liability:** Demonstrates a commitment to security, potentially lowering insurance costs and legal exposure.
*   **Improved Occupant Safety:** Creates a safer environment for employees, visitors, and residents.
