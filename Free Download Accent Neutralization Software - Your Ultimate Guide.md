## What Exactly Is Accent Neutralization?

Accent neutralization is the process of modifying one's pronunciation to conform to a more widely understood standard, typically General American English.

*   **Pronunciation of Vowels and Consonants:** Achieving accurate articulation of individual sounds.
*   **Stress and Intonation:** Mastering the rhythm and melody of the English language.
*   **Pace and Clarity:** Speaking at a moderate speed with distinct enunciation.
*   **Common Pronunciation Errors:** Identifying and correcting frequently made mistakes.
*   **Listening Comprehension:** Training your ear to recognize and understand different accents.
