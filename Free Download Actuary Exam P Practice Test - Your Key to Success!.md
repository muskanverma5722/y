5.  **Track Your Progress:** Keep track of your scores on practice tests over time. This will allow you to see how you're improving and identify any areas where you're plateauing.
6.  **Don't Memorize Answers:** The goal of practice tests is not to memorize answers but to understand the concepts and develop your problem-solving skills. Focus on understanding the reasoning behind each answer rather than simply memorizing the solution.
7.  **Mix Up Your Practice:** Don't just work through the practice problems in order. Mix them up to keep yourself challenged and prevent yourself from becoming too familiar with the problems.
8.  **Take Breaks:** Don't try to cram all your studying into one long session. Take breaks to avoid burnout and allow your brain to process the information.
