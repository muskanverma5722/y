## Key Active Reading Techniques Explained

Let's break down some of the core active reading techniques you'll learn in the course:

*   **Previewing:** Before diving into the text, take a few minutes to preview the material. Read the title, headings, subheadings, and any introductory or concluding paragraphs. This gives you a roadmap of the content and helps you anticipate what you'll be learning.
*   **Setting a Purpose:** Ask yourself, "Why am I reading this?" Are you trying to learn something new, prepare for an exam, or simply gain a better understanding of a topic? Setting a purpose helps you focus your attention and direct your reading efforts.
*   **Asking Questions:** As you read, ask yourself questions about the material. What are the main points? What evidence supports the author's claims? Do you agree with the author's conclusions? Questioning encourages you to think critically and engage with the text on a deeper level.
*   **Annotating:** Annotating involves marking up the text with notes, highlights, and symbols. Highlight key passages, write marginal notes summarizing main points, and use symbols to indicate areas of confusion or agreement.
*   **Summarizing:** After reading a section or chapter, take a few minutes to summarize the main points in your own words. This helps you consolidate your understanding and identify any areas where you need to review the material.
*   **Paraphrasing:** Paraphrasing involves restating the author's ideas in your own language. This helps you ensure that you truly understand the material and avoid simply memorizing words.
*   **Connecting:** As you read, try to connect the material to your own experiences, prior knowledge, and other things you've learned. This helps you make the material more meaningful and memorable.
